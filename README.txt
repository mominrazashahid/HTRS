# HTRS
I have developed a Handwritten text recognition system that recognizes the handwritten text for A4 size paper.
I used Simple HTR already open-source model which is for recognizing the single word and I extend the model by using the technique of segmentation which recognize and make the segmentation of word then simple HTR recognize each word and combine into a full recognize string. 
Here is the link to simple HTR master https://github.com/githubharald/SimpleHTR
What can be improved
This system cannot detect the next line, because segmentation only detects the words from top to bottom not line if we can update the model to detect line then it can be improved.
